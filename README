The install-driver.sh script will build the kernel drivers for wifi and Bluetooth and install the proper Rf power tables along with the chip firmware.
Please note however that the install-driver.sh script does NEITHER insert the driver modules into linux kernel NOR does it set them up for plug n play.

To run the install-driver.sh script, execute ./install-driver.sh ant=<fractus|gw40|fxp832|walsin>

Note about antenna:
There may be support for only one antenna type. In this case you may omit the ant=xxx argument.
If several antenna options are available and you don't know antenna type, fractus is probably your best bet.

By default, the install-driver.sh script will perform a native build for the current platform (only x86 and arm are supported).

For cross-compilation, you'll need to split the install-driver.sh script into two parts: One part to be executed in the host computer where only cross-compilation takes place
and one part, in which the build step must be excluded, to be executed on the target

Please read document '1543 - SPB209A EVB - Driver Install User Guide' for instructions how to insert the driver modules into linux kernel
